# HobbyConnect-Server
## The server for my [HobbyConnect app](https://github.com/giladdani/HobbyConnect-Client)
This is a RESTful API made specifically for it.
Integrating with the app's database at MongoDB Atlas, this API provides access to resources like Users, Activities, GiftCodes and more.
Most endpoints require user authentication by JWT.
